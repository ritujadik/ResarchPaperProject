- Filters for non-academic authors (pharma/biotech affiliations)
- Command-line interface with options for debug info, output file, email & API key
- Outputs data including PubMed ID, title, publication date, author affiliations, and corresponding author email
- Written in typed Python with Poetry for dependency management
